## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js and npm/yarn (if Node.js backend)]
*   [PHP and Composer (if PHP backend)]
*   [Python and pip (if Python backend)]
*   [MySQL/PostgreSQL Server or MongoDB instance]
*   A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx if using PHP, or handled by Node/Python framework)
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your_Username]/OmachaShop.git
    cd OmachaShop
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    *   **[For Node.js]:**
        ```bash
        # Navigate to backend directory (if you have one)
        # cd backend
        npm install
        # Create a .env file based on .env.example and configure database credentials
        # Run database migrations/seeds if applicable
        # npm start (or your specific start script)
        ```
    *   **[For PHP/Laravel]:**
        ```bash
        # Navigate to project directory
        composer install
        cp .env.example .env
        php artisan key:generate
        # Configure your database credentials in .env
        php artisan migrate --seed # (if applicable)
        php artisan serve
        ```
    *   **[Provide specific instructions based on YOUR backend stack]**

3.  **Frontend Setup (if separate from backend or needs building):**
    *   **[For plain HTML/CSS/JS or if using a frontend build tool]:**
        ```bash
        # Navigate to frontend directory (if you have one)
        # npm install (if you have frontend dependencies like SASS, etc.)
        # npm run build (if you have a build step)
        ```
    *   If frontend is served by the backend framework, this step might not be needed separately.

4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Create a new database named `[your_database_name]`.
    *   Import the database schema/data if you have an SQL dump file (`database.sql` or similar).
    *   Ensure your application's database configuration ÿßŸÑÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ÿ© points to this database with correct credentials.

5.  **Accessing the Application:**
    *   **Customer Site:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT_NUMBER]` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for Node, `http://localhost:8000` for Laravel/Django).
    *   **Admin Panel:** Access via `http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT_NUMBER]/admin` (or your specific admin route).
        *   Default admin credentials (if any): `Username: [admin_user]`, `Password: [admin_pass]`
